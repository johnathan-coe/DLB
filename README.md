# Introduction

This project contains a lightweight instance of DLB (Dynamic Lightweight Blogging), a framework I created for my own personal use.
The idea to build this was heavily inspired by Luke Smith's project 'lb' which aims to provide self-hosted blogging capabilities to users. lb is designed to be lightweight (under 100 lines of bash script) while still providing everything to be expected of a traditional blogging platform.

# What sets DLB apart

This project aims to have feature parity with lb whilst having the following advantages:

- **No command line post management** Listings, Standalone Posts, etc. are generated on the fly
- **Familiar syntax** inspired by the Django / Jinja templating system
- **Lightweight** with less than 100 lines of python
